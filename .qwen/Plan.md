## Phase 1: Foundation & Tooling Setup (Security, Tool Compliance, Complexity Reduction)

**Objective:** Establish a robust development environment, integrate mandated tools, and perform initial project analysis, specifically for this Django MVT project.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Environment Verification & Setup:**
    *   Confirm `uv` is installed and functional for Python package management.
    *   Ensure all Python package management and execution uses `uv`, `uv run`, `uvx` exclusively.
    *   **`uv` will manage Python dependencies primarily via `pyproject.toml`.**
    *   Install and configure static analysis tools:
        *   **Ruff:** Configure `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.ruff]` section, targeting Python files in `eventMan/`, `events/`, `manage.py`, and other project modules.
            *   **Exclusions:** Exclude directories like `.git`, `.venv/`, `migrations/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.pytest_cache/`.
            *   **Rule Sets:** Select `E`, `F`, `W`, `I`, `N`, `D`, `UP`, `DJ`, `RUF`.
            *   **Line Length:** Set to 120 characters.
            *   **Ignoring Rules:** Consider ignoring `E501` (if using Black), `A003` (Django's 'id'), `B904`.
            *   **Integration:** Plan for pre-commit hooks and IDE integration.
        *   **Biome:** Configure `biome.json` for frontend JavaScript and CSS files in `static/src/js/`, `static/src/css/`, and `static/src/input.css`. (Biome is not used for Python).
    *   Install complexity analysis tools:
        *   **Radon:** Ensure it's installable via `uvx` and ready to analyze Python code in `eventMan/` and `events/`.
        *   **Frontend Complexity Report:** Confirm `package.json` has a `complexity-report` script, or guide its addition.
    *   **Hammett Integration:** Install Hammett via `uv`. Configure `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py` in `events/tests/` to work with Hammett and `pytest-django` for faster backend test execution, focusing on relevant tests based on code changes.
    *   Confirm `npm` and `npx` are available for frontend tasks.
2.  **Project Dependency Analysis:**
    *   **Frontend Dependencies (from `package.json`):** `tailwindcss` (^3.4.17), `autoprefixer` (^10.4.21), `postcss` (^8.5.6), `tailwindcss-animate` (^1.0.7).
    *   **Backend Dependencies (from `pyproject.toml`):** Django (5.2.7), `django-allauth` (65.12.1), `django-crispy-forms` (2.4), `django-debug-toolbar` (6.0.0), `django-htmx` (1.26.0), `django-redis` (6.0.0), `uvicorn` (23.0.0), `psycopg2-binary` (2.9.11), `whitenoise` (6.11.0), `cloudinary` (1.44.1), `faker` (37.11.0), `factory-boy` (3.3.3), `pytest` (8.4.2), `python-decouple` (3.8), `python-dotenv` (1.1.1), `dj-database-url` (3.0.1), `hammett` (0.10.0), `sslcommerz-lib` (1.0), `upstash-redis` (1.4.0), `anyio` (4.11.0), `httpx` (0.28.1), `requests` (2.32.5), and others.
    *   **Target Latest Versions (as of Oct 2025):**

    *   **Note:** Versions for some packages were not definitively found for Oct 2025. These will be updated using current versions from `pyproject.toml` and flagged for manual verification.
3.  **Initial Codebase Scan:**
    *   Analyze the Django MVT structure: `eventMan/settings.py`, `eventMan/urls.py`, `events/models.py`, `events/views.py`, `events/urls.py`, `templates/`, `static/`.
    *   Identify complexity hotspots in views (`events/views.py`), models (`events/models.py`), and template logic in `templates/` (e.g., `base.html`, `events/event_detail.html`).
    *   Identify areas for potential O(1) optimization in database queries within `events/models.py` and `events/views.py` (e.g., using `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, `values()`, `only()`, `defer()`), authentication (`django.contrib.auth` in `eventMan/settings.py`), and caching (`django.core.cache` in `eventMan/settings.py`).

## Phase 2: Version Updates & Dependency Management (Zero Waste, Complexity Reduction)

**Objective:** Update all project dependencies to their latest stable versions and ensure a clean, minimal dependency set, using `pyproject.toml` as the source of truth for Python.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Package Versioning:**
    *   Update backend dependencies in `pyproject.toml` using `uv` (e.g., `uv add <package>==<latest_version> --python-version <version>`) to the target latest stable versions.
    *   Update frontend dependencies in `package.json` to target latest versions.
    *   Run `npm install` to install frontend packages.
    *   **Regenerate `requirements.txt`:** After updating `pyproject.toml`, run `uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt`. This ensures `requirements.txt` remains a consistent, human-readable snapshot of the dependencies managed by `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Run `uv sync` to ensure the Python environment is consistent.
2.  **Dependency Audit:**
    *   Analyze `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, and `requirements.txt` for unused or redundant packages. Remove them to minimize attack surface and complexity.

## Phase 3: Security Hardening & O(1) Optimization (Security, Complexity Reduction, Time Complexity Goal)

**Objective:** Enhance application security and aggressively pursue O(1) time complexity for critical Django operations.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Security Audit & Remediation:**
    *   Scan Django-specific vulnerabilities: CSRF protection (`eventMan/settings.py`), XSS prevention (template autoescaping in `templates/`), SQL Injection (ORM usage in `events/models.py`), insecure direct object references.
    *   Implement security best practices: secure password hashing, rate limiting, input validation.
    *   Focus on O(1) lookups for authentication (`django.contrib.auth` backend in `eventMan/settings.py`) and authorization (permission checks in `events/views.py`).
    *   Configure explicit timeouts for all server operations (e.g., in `eventMan/settings.py` or via WSGI/ASGI server configuration).
2.  **O(1) Implementation Drive:**
    *   Refactor database queries in `events/views.py` and `events/models.py` to use `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, `values()`, `only()`, `defer()` for O(1) or near-O(1) data retrieval where possible.
    *   Optimize caching strategies in `eventMan/settings.py` for frequently accessed data.
    *   Apply O(1) principles to critical paths: user login/logout, permission checks, core data fetching in views.

## Phase 4: Code Refactoring & Simplification (Complexity Reduction, Structural Maintainability, Readability, Zero Waste)

**Objective:** Improve code quality, maintainability, readability, and reduce overall complexity within the Django MVT structure.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Static Analysis & Linting:**
    *   Execute Ruff on all Python files (`eventMan/`, `events/`, `manage.py`, etc.). Address all reported issues.
    *   Execute Biome on frontend files (`static/src/js/`, `static/src/css/`, `static/src/input.css`). Address all reported issues.
    *   Ensure consistent code formatting across the project.
2.  **Code Restructuring:**
    *   Break down large Django views (`events/views.py`) into smaller, reusable functions or class-based views.
    *   Separate utility functions into dedicated modules (e.g., `events/utils.py` if not already present, or within `events/storage_utils.py`, `events/payment_utils.py`).
    *   Organize `events/forms/` and `events/management/commands/` logically.
    *   Refactor complex template logic in `templates/` for simplicity and beginner-friendliness.
    *   Enforce DRY principles across views, models, and templates. Eliminate dead code.

## Phase 5: Documentation & Testing (Readability, Zero Placeholders, Tool Compliance)

**Objective:** Ensure comprehensive documentation, robust testing, and adherence to the "zero placeholders" mandate, with an academic/learning focus.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Documentation Enhancement:**
    *   Add "why" comments (CSE Principle) for algorithmic choices (e.g., "Using `prefetch_related` for O(N+1) query optimization as per [Academic Source X]").
    *   Add "business value/ROI" comments (BBA/Marketing Principle) for endpoints or features (e.g., "This endpoint serves the primary user registration metric, crucial for customer acquisition [Kotler, Ch. Y]").
    *   Incorporate relevant academic citations:
        *   **General Web Dev:** MLA, APA, Chicago styles for web sources.
        *   **Performance:** Research on WPO techniques, impact on UX, metrics (TTI, FCP), challenges.
        *   **Security:** OWASP Top Ten, research on injection attacks, XSS, CSRF, secure coding, DevSecOps, SAST/DAST.
        *   **Business/Marketing:** Kotler & Keller's principles on customer value, segmentation, targeting, positioning, integrated marketing, brand equity, ROI measurement (CAC, CLV).
        *   **Philosophical Approaches:** Consider principles from thinkers like Aristotle (efficiency, virtue) or Occam (simplicity) where relevant to code design.
    *   Ensure code is self-explanatory and serves as a learning resource for beginners ("noobs").
2.  **Testing Implementation:**
    *   Ensure comprehensive backend test coverage using Django's testing framework (likely `pytest` given `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py` in `events/tests/`).
    *   **Hammett Integration:** Configure Hammett to run relevant tests efficiently, complementing the existing `pytest` setup.
    *   Verify zero placeholder functions/endpoints in views, models, and management commands.

---

## Phase 6: Final Verification & Complexity Reporting (Tool Compliance, Zero Errors, Zero Waste)

**Objective:** Conduct final checks, report complexity metrics, and prepare for production.

**Key Activities:**
1.  **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Run backend complexity analysis: `uvx radon cc -a -n "C" -O json .` (Analyze Python code in `eventMan/`, `events/`, etc.).
    *   Run frontend complexity analysis: `npx run complexity-report` (Analyze JS/CSS in `static/src/`).
    *   Address any high complexity scores, prioritizing reduction.
2.  **Final Quality Assurance:**
    *   Re-run Ruff and Biome.
    *   Execute all backend tests (e.g., `uv run pytest` or `uv run hammett`).
    *   Confirm zero errors, zero waste, and full compliance with all mandates.
3.  **Production Readiness:**
    *   Final review of server handling timeouts.
    *   Ensure `uv` is used for all environment setup.
