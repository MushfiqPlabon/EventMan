# EventMan: Event Management System

## Overview

EventMan is a comprehensive web-based Event Management System built with Django, designed to provide a robust platform for organizing, managing, and participating in various events. This project originally served as an assignment for Week 3, Module 9, updated as a part of Week 4, Module 14, further updated on Week 5, Module 18 (mid-term-exam) of Phitron's Software Development Track (SDT)'s Software Development Project (SDP) course, demonstrating advanced Django features and a modern frontend with Tailwind CSS. But I have changed a lot of stuff around since then.

The application now features a modern, visually stunning "Reactive Glass UI" with comprehensive glassmorphism, real-time reactivity powered by HTMX, and enhanced microinteractions for a truly engaging user experience. It empowers organizers with efficient management tools and provides participants with a user-friendly experience, complete with authentication, role-based access, and RSVP functionality.

## Features

- **UI/UX Overhaul: Reactive Glass UI:** A modern, visually stunning design with comprehensive glassmorphism, transparency, blur, and consistent styling across the entire application.
- **Real-time Reactivity (HTMX):** Dynamic content updates and seamless microinteractions across the UI, including live statistics on the homepage and real-time updates on all dashboards (Participant, Organizer, Admin).
- **Enhanced Microinteractions:** Subtle and engaging animations on interactive elements (buttons, cards, links, form inputs) for hover, focus, click, and state changes, powered by `tailwindcss-animate`. This includes a consolidated and enhanced notification system, smooth HTMX content transitions, and improved focus/hover effects for form inputs and interactive elements.
- **Payment Gateway Integration (SSLCommerz):** Secure and seamless payment processing for events, including a dedicated checkout page and graceful handling of payment responses.
- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user signup, login, and logout.
- **Email Activation:** Mandatory email verification for new accounts with secure activation links.
- **Custom Signup Fields:** Includes additional fields like first name and last name during user registration.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - **Admin:** Full access to all features, including user and group management.
  - **Organizer:** Can create, update, and delete events and categories they manage.
  - **Participant:** Can view events and RSVP to them.
- **User-Specific Dashboards:** Redirects users to their respective dashboards (Admin, Organizer, Participant) upon login, with real-time updates for key metrics and data.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** An intuitive homepage for organizers providing a quick overview of key metrics:
  - Total number of events.
  - Total registered participants across all events.
  - Count of past events.
  - Count of upcoming events.
  - A list of events scheduled for the current day.
- **Interactive Stats:** Clickable statistics on the dashboard that link to filtered event lists.
- **Event Management (CRUD):**
  - **Create:** Add new events with details like name, date, time, location, description, category, and an associated image.
  - **Read:** View a list of all events, and detailed information for each event, including participants.
  - **Update:** Modify existing event details (restricted to organizer or admin).
  - **Delete:** Remove events from the system (restricted to organizer or admin).
- **Category Management (CRUD):** Create, view, update, and delete different categories for events (e.g., "Conference," "Workshop," "Concert").
- **RSVP System:**
  - Participants can easily RSVP to events they are interested in.
  - Prevents duplicate RSVPs for the same event.
  - Participants can view events they have RSVP'd to on their dedicated dashboard.
- **Email Notifications:** Automated email confirmation sent to users upon successful RSVP.
- **Django Signals:** Utilizes Django's signal framework to automate processes like sending RSVP confirmation emails and account activation emails.
- **Media File Handling:** Events can have associated images with a default image fallback, stored externally via Cloudinary.
- **Optimized Queries:** Efficient database interactions using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for fetching related data, and aggregate queries for statistics.
- **Search & Filter:** Easily find events by name, location, or filter by category and date range.
- **Responsive Design:** User-friendly interface across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop), powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **Dark Mode:** Client-side dark mode toggle for improved user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get EventMan up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/EventMan-Phi-Assign.git
    # Or
    gh repo clone MushfiqPlabon/EventMan-Phi-Assign
    cd EventMan-Phi-Assign
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    This project uses `uv` for fast and reliable dependency management. Ensure `uv` is installed (e.g., `pip install uv`).

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    > **Note:** For Vercel deployment, a `requirements.txt` file is generated from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` during the build process.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    This project uses a `.env` file for environment variables. An example file (`.env.example`) is provided to make setup easier.

    1.  Copy the example file to create your local environment file:
        ```bash
        # On macOS/Linux
        cp .env.example .env
        # On Windows
        copy .env.example .env
        ```
    2.  Open the newly created `.env` file and customize the variables. **It is crucial to fill in all required values for external services (Database, Redis, Cloudinary, Email) if you intend to deploy or use these features locally.** You should also generate a new `SECRET_KEY`.

    > **Security Note:** The `.env` file is ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`) and should never be committed to version control. The project's `settings.py` is configured to automatically switch between configurations based on environment variables. For local development, if `DATABASE_URL` is not set, it will fall back to SQLite. `DEBUG` should be `True` for local development and `False` for production.

5.  **Install NPM dependencies and initialize Tailwind CSS:**
    The project includes `package.json`, so you just need to install the dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6.  **Run Tailwind CSS development server (in a separate terminal):**
    This command watches for changes in your frontend assets and provides hot-reloading. Keep it running during development.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7.  **Run Tailwind CSS build (for production deployment or initial setup):**
    This command compiles your Tailwind CSS for production.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

8.  **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

9.  **Create a Django superuser (for admin access):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

10. **Create Django Groups for RBAC (via Admin Panel):**

    1.  Run `python manage.py runserver`.
    2.  Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.
    3.  Log in with your superuser credentials.
    4.  Navigate to "Groups" (under "Authentication and Authorization").
    5.  Add two new groups: `Organizer` and `Participant`.

12. **Run Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
    This project uses `pytest` for comprehensive testing. Ensure your virtual environment is active.

    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```

    Test configurations, including global mocks for static files and Cloudinary, are managed in `conftest.py` at the project root.

13. **Run the Django development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Deployment on Render

This project is configured for deployment on Render. Follow these steps to deploy:

1.  **External Service Setup:**
    *   **Database:** Set up an external PostgreSQL database (e.g., ElephantSQL, Supabase, or a Render PostgreSQL instance) and obtain its connection URL.
    *   **Redis:** Set up an external Redis service (e.g., Upstash Redis or a Render Redis instance) and obtain its URL.
    *   **Cloudinary:** Create a Cloudinary account and obtain your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret.
    *   **Email:** Configure an SMTP service for sending emails (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid) and obtain the necessary credentials.

2.  **Render Project Setup:**
    *   Create a new "Web Service" on Render and link it to your Git repository.

3.  **Configure Environment on Render:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** In your Render service settings, go to "Environment" and add all the variables listed in `.env.example` with their actual values from your external services. **Crucially, set `DEBUG` to `False` for production.**
    *   **Build Command:** Set the build command to `./build.sh`. This script will install Node.js dependencies and build the Tailwind CSS assets. Render will automatically install Python dependencies from your `pyproject.toml` file.
    *   **Start Command:** For production, you should use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn. Set the start command to `gunicorn eventMan.wsgi`.
    *   **Database Migrations:** Render can run database migrations on deploy. You can add `python manage.py migrate` as a post-deploy command in the Render dashboard, or add it to your `build.sh` script.

4.  **Deployment:**
    *   Once the service is configured, Render will automatically build and deploy your application on every push to your connected Git branch.

## Testing and Usage 🧪

### Comprehensive Test Suite

**Key aspects of the test suite:**
*   **Frameworks:** `pytest`, `pytest-django`, `hammett`, `factory-boy`, `Faker`, `pytest-mock`.
*   **Coverage:** Dedicated test files for:
    *   Models (`events/tests/test_models.py`)
    *   Views (`events/tests/test_views.py`)
    *   Forms (`events/tests/test_forms.py`)
    *   Signals (`events/tests/test_signals.py`)
    *   Management Commands (`events/tests/test_management_commands.py`)
    *   Payment Gateway Integration (`events/tests/test_payments.py`)
    *   Dashboards (`events/tests/test_dashboards.py`)
*   **Dynamic Data:** Utilizes `factory-boy` and `Faker` to create realistic and varied test data on-the-fly, reducing boilerplate and improving test maintainability.
*   **Mocks:** Employs `pytest-mock` for effective mocking of external dependencies (e.g., Cloudinary uploads, SSLCommerz API calls, static file lookups) to ensure fast and isolated tests.
*   **Global Fixtures:** Common test setup (like global mocks) is managed in `conftest.py` at the project root.

To run the tests, ensure your virtual environment is active and execute:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Populating Demo Data

To quickly set up your database with sample users, categories, and events for testing and demonstration purposes, **especially to experience the new UI/UX and real-time features**, use the `populate_demo_data` management command.

```bash
python manage.py populate_demo_data
```

This command will create:
*   **Admin User:** `username=admin`, `password=admin123`
*   **Organizer User:** `username=organizer`, `password=organizer123`
*   **Participant User:** `username=participant`, `password=participant123`

It will also create sample categories and events, including upcoming, past, and draft events. If these users or data already exist, the command will skip their creation.
